# PITTI AUTO PREFLIGHT — MANDATORY

Use before every PITTI AUTO execution and after any chat handoff. This is an execution gate, not optional documentation.

## 1. SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Read `PITTI_PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Identify newest material decisions and NEXT GATE.
- Verify relevant branch/build/artifact/runtime instead of assuming the document is still current.
- If reality differs, repair `PITTI_PROJECT_STATE.md` before proceeding.

## 2. ANTI-REGRESSION
Before acting, answer internally:
- Is this approach already recorded as failed/rejected?
- Am I reintroducing an old expert, format, UI behavior, ranking assumption, roster-cap error, duplicate-snapshot bug, or stale-data path?
- Is there a regression test/guard that should protect this rule?
- Am I confusing built/prepared with Android verified?
If any answer is unsafe/unknown, inspect evidence first.

## 3. END-TO-END ROUTE
- Define the shortest robust path from current state to the actual user goal.
- Confirm prerequisites exist before changing code.
- Prefer additive/small changes near draft freeze.
- Do not create parallel infrastructure when an existing verified capability already solves the problem.

## 4. AUTO CONTINUITY
- Execute all autonomously possible steps before messaging user.
- If lane A waits, work lane B/C when independent and useful.
- Do not send 'next I will...' when that next step can be done now.
- Status-only output is prohibited while meaningful autonomous work remains.

## 5. CHECKPOINT WRITE-THROUGH
Immediately update `PITTI_PROJECT_STATE.md` after material:
- requirement/decision change,
- implementation or promotion,
- runtime verification,
- new failure/root cause,
- rejected approach,
- artifact/version/hash change,
- priority/next-gate change.

## 6. USER INTERRUPTION TEST
Interrupt only if at least one is true:
- user/device action is technically unavoidable now,
- required information cannot be obtained autonomously,
- irreversible/destructive/security-sensitive action needs approval,
- unresolved contradiction makes further work unsafe,
- a meaningful completed artifact/result now requires runtime verification.
Otherwise continue AUTO.

## 7. PITTI-SPECIFIC CANARIES
- Draft identity includes Draft-ID; cross-draft duplicate false positives forbidden.
- Half-PPR 1QB; reject Superflex/2QB.
- Starter maxima are not roster caps.
- K/DST normally not drafted.
- Geno Smith/Aaron Rodgers excluded from user's QB path.
- Excess WR depth must materially reduce redundant WR utility.
- Expert-v2: Brown excluded; Erickson challenger; Koerner no current-draft acquisition effort; Mariano availability already solved; Draft Sharks counted as one correlated family; temporary Weisse/Gianni/Bobal pool rejected.
- Final expert weights require current-board analysis; do not invent them.
